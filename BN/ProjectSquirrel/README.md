# What is Project: Pack Rat?

Project: "Pack Rat Mode" provides comprehensive sci-fi contents. The mod adds combat armor and futuristic weapons, making gameplay more exciting, improving usability, and providing expanded end content.  Unlock atomic-powered tech to gain access to more advanced science! With new equipment and features, this mod will provide players with a more enriching experience.

Yes, all of the sci-fi content in my mod uses a tech tree approach where you start with an Atomic Forge, build a tool called a Matter Synthesizer, and "evolve" the tool through crafting to unlock the number of different sci-fi items you can make. It's a bit like Starbound. At the "Matter Synthesizer: nano-precision sewing machines" stage, you can create not only CBMs, but also RAM, circuits, e-scraps, solar cells, and other materials that have been difficult to source in large quantities. You can create 7 different types of unique combat armor, 7 hard-light weapons, which are fast and accurate optical weapons, and 5 Gauss weapons, which are high-firepowered railguns powered by fusion cores. You can craft 5.56mm, 7.62mm, and 8x40mm with depleted uranium penetrators. You can find recipes in the previously useless Lab journal - Gustav, and the Lab journal - Herrera, where you can create useful electronics, and Rivtech design binders. Recipes for hard-light and Gaussian weapons are rarely found in the lab. I'm creating a faction that will have an impact later in the game.

In addition, I've prepared several items that can be used even before the SF phase and QoL: 4 types of basic shields and 3 types of tactical shields, 6 types of frame packs and 3 types of powered exoskeletons, a dimensional backpack with a huge storage capacity, and a series of 34 survival fireproof items. Most of the clothes can be lined with steel plates or superalloy plates, and we've also added features such as Nomex lining, reducing interference, and adding pockets.

* Project: Pack Rat requires playing with the latest version of BN to enjoy the content.

## 1. Add practical compression storage items

Bundles of Rags 1L>0.5L

Bundles of Leathers 1L>0.5L

Bundles of Kevlar plates

Bundles of Nomex

Bundles of Plastic chunks

Bundles of Chitins

Bundles of Biosilicified Chitins

Bundles of Planks

Bundles of Splintered Wood

Bundle of Glass Shards

Bundle of Wires

Bundle of pipes

Bundle of scrap metal

Bundles of layered carbides

## 2. Build a nanomaterial container, add a portable CVD machine

Requires at least Lab Report-Gustav to build these.
In PPR 1.1, main tools will all be unified as 'Matter Synthesizer: Lorem Ipsum', and you will be able to evolve your own main tools to increase your skills, so you can make them in one tool instead of having to make multiple tools.

Tier 1: Atomic Forge (Graphene, Layered Carbide)
Manupulator workbench (workbench that allows you to work at twice the speed)

┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛ 

Tier 2: Matter Synthesizer: Nanocompressor (hydrogen container, nanofabricated materials, superalloys)

*Superalloys can be disassembled with a metal saw to get thin superalloys.

┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛ 

Tier 3: Matter Synthesizer: Nano-precision sewing machines (e-scraps, RAM, circuits, copper wire, solar cells, CBMs, AI cores, hardlight matrices, fusion cores)

┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛ 

- Tier 4: Matter Synthesizer: Nanoprinter (all RM weapon series and RM13 Combat Armor, all Combat Armors, Hardlight weapons, Gauss weapons)

- Portable CVD Machine: Set up, examine, and use as is. To retrieve it, smash it with S.

## 3. Other items added

- Advanced Nomad Suit/Nomad Harness: from DDA. Recipe from the book Surviving a Nuclear War.
- Type-Boy: Smartwatch + bionic scanner + binocular function + two-way radio + radiation biomonitor. You know the motif.
- Ranger Lightweight Combat Armor: Non-powered combat suit. A combination of various survival sets. A parody of the NCR Ranger combat armor from Fallout series.
- Carbon Jumpsuit (a mass-produced, high-performance survival suit that can be made cheaply).
- Nanopack bandages (bandages that instantly restore 20 health upon application)
- Monomolecular wire: memorization made from monomolecular fibers. Extremely small in volume and capable of 3-square attacks. Has a -2 hit modifier instead.
- Bionic Splint: A splint that attaches limbs 4x faster and is less intrusive.
- Craftable hydrogen tanks and hydrogen canisters (needed for diamond coating).
- Binary Sword: Used by Jesus in Madness Combat. Reborn in the Cataclysm.
- Heat Blade: A shish kebab, a battery-consuming sharp-edged hot plate. Can set enemies on fire, of course.
- Fire weapons are back. (from Nohope mod)
- Bone armor can be crafted. (from No Hope mod)
- Low to Mid tier bionics also can be crafted.
- Hardlight weapons: Highly advanced optical weapons that feed on the Hardlight Matrix. They disrupt the wavelengths of light and fire what they solidify, making it possible to recreate lightsabers and blasters from the original movies with solidified light. These weapons are characterized by high hit rate, short range, and anti-personnel. Ammo uses UPS power.
- Gaussian weapons: High mass weapons that feed on fusion cores, or fusion cores. These are the arc reactors from the movie What's up? You can't use fusion cores directly, but you can build Gauss weapons, which are personalized railguns. You can also create mechs, which I'll talk about later. Features include Barrett-like damage, low rate of fire, large and heavy, and the ability to break through walls and zombie skulls. Ammunition is steel rails, degraded uranium rails, and scrap metal (!).
- Fireproof Gears:

## 4. Make Your Own Combat Armor

With the final content, you can create combat armor with different capabilities to suit your needs and preferences.
Open to all common crafting 10 Computers 10 Electrical Engineering 10 Mechanical Engineering 10

Survival Combat Armor (requires a Rivtech design binders)
- A survivalist version of the Rivtech RM13 Combat Armor, with the design hastened by the setting. It is a sub-compatible version of the RM13 Combat Armor, with no armor increase when activated and a higher level of encumberance. Used as a material for the following three armors.

"Rampart" Assault Armor

- Semi-rigid combat armor made to resemble a walking tank. Increases strength by 2x when worn.
- When used by a Survivor who fully understands the design of the Rivtech Combat Armor, it increases armor and grants additional parrying abilities, making it even more invulnerable in melee.
- The Combat Armor's built-in circulatory management system provides a constant supply of oxygen, dramatically increasing stamina regeneration.

"Corsair" Blitz Strike Suit

- Non-rigid combat armor with the exact opposite characteristics of the Rampart.
- It has low armor, but when worn, it increases your movement speed by 30% and increases your agility and perception by 3.
- A versatile suit that can also be used as a work suit during the day thanks to its high Action Speed passive.
- Its special ability allows you to stop time for 10 turns for 500 Power.
- Combat Armor's built-in Synaptic Accelerator allows you to automatically parkour on tables, ledges, etc. without losing any Action Points.

"Pioneer" Environmental Carapace

- Non-rigid combat armor with defenses between Rampart and Corsair.
- It has particularly high environmental protection and provides built-in gas, electricity, climate control system, and radiation immunity.
- The special ability grants full protection from mind control and climate conditions, and prevents teleportation sickness.
- In addition, the Combat Armor's built-in penetrating scanner provides moderate range vision, making it the GOAT in terms of convenience.

Plus, they come in four different paint schemes: Military, Black, Urban, and Desert.
Think of it as a skin concept, and if you don't like the look of your existing suit, it's very easy to slap on a paint job for a different suit. In short, it's a looker.
And the visor skins, including the existing suit, come in the following colors: red orange (yellow) green sky blue purple white.

"Warden" Heavy Combat Armor

- Clunky combat armor that's cheap and can mimic Rampart at relatively low tiers. Think of it as a survivor's version of a power armor.
- The arms are equipped with hydraulic muscles that, when activated, allow you to smash zombie heads like melting butter while unarmed.
- It's a great value for the price.

"Legion" Powered Suit

- A actual military suit. Holds 4 weapons of any type, 1.7x weight limit, increased healing speed, 2x perception, and more for the next generation of supersoldiers.
- The best part is that it's always on, even when it's not.
- It costs 100 power to use and instantly creates a blade-shaped plasma impact grenade, with the performance of this melee weapon and grenade depending on how strategically you use it.
- Obtained from blueprint Drops.

"Revenant" Assassination Infiltration Suit

- An actual military suit #2. In the setting, this fearsome armor has a history of being used in small batches to assassinate enemy nationals during the Chinese-American War.
- The suit's fluid upper construction of liquefied smart metal provides noise cancellation and body odor concealment.
- Defense is below Corsair, but the special ability Stealth makes up for it.
- The extra liquefied metal in hands can be used to transform them into blades, giving it enough killing power even when unarmed.
- Obtained from blueprint drops.

## 5. Add more items

Loop of Rope: from DDA.

Shields

- Plank Shield: A bundle of planks that can be crafted in crafting level 1.
- Scrap Metal Shield: a metal plate with a handle.
- Small Riot Shield: A buckler-shaped polearm.
- Riot Shield: The plastic shield we all know. A very large plastic shield. When used, the shield can be raised into a defensive stance.
- Tactical shield: Commando: Holds 2 magazines. Relatively lightweight. Begins to have legitimate bulletproof properties.
- Tactical Shield: Bastion: A 12-kilogram bulletproof shield. R6S Montagne's specialty, of course. Provides full-body protection.
- Tactical Shield: Frontline: A lighter version of the above shield, The Division 2 themed. Allows two-handed weapons. Can be used to shield all but the legs.

- Dimensional Stabilizer: Lab drop backpack that provides 300L. Also available in black.

## 6. Balance Patches

Fixed weird cat mutation sprites.

Added barometer recipe.

Added Monomolecular Blade and Bionic Claws to Escrima-applied weapons.

Changed the attack type of the Monomolecular Blade to Piercing.

Added 40x46 Rivtech shell-less grenades.

Added a 2-square distance attack to the Zweihander

Reduced the weight of the RM103A Automagnum by 200 grams and the RM2000 Submachine Gun by 300 grams.

Added a 2-point burst fire mode to the RM103A Magnum.

Added 50- and 100-round magazines to the range of compatible magazines to address the RM2000 submachine gun's ambiguous status as a smg in terms of portability with small 25-round magazine capacity, and it was backward compatibility with the RM51 assault rifle with folding buttstock.
* I've also modified it to spawn with a 50-round magazine inserted, giving it a lighter, smaller mini-assault rifle vibes.

Added a recipe for 8x40 ammo shells. The path to obtaining the recipe is the same as for the crafted 8x40 JHP.

Increased the Hardtacks' batch production(b) speed bonuses from 50% to 83%. Biscuits can now be used as a valuable late-game preserve.

UPS and Advanced UPS can now be equipped.

Tankbots, Tri-Pods, and Chicken Walkers can now be disassembled and crafted.

Removed equipment restrictions for all variants. (e.g., the Fluffy Tail mutation used to prevent you from wearing Combat Armor or Power Armor.)

Power Armor is now tagged with the OVERSIZE tag, meaning that characters with the Giant Mutation can now wear Power Armor.

- Become a Power Armor Super Mutant and enjoy the apocalypse!
* Pointed horns, Antlers and Antennae traits are hardcoded to not wear normal-sized helmets!

Bank Vault: Increased drop chance of certain books to 1.5x.

- Rivtech design binders
- Lab Journal - Gustav
* Most of the core items in the current mode come from these two books.

Added weapon categories with corresponding martial arts.

- Eskrima: Sword
- Barbaran Montante: one-handed hammer, two-handed hammer, one-handed axe, flail, mace
- Fencing: Sword
- Silat: Sword
- Ninjutsu: Sword
* Weirdly, when the game updated the weapon categories, some of the weapons that used to have a sword type were lost, so I fixed that.

## 7. Sprite patches

I changed the dots on the ones I didn't like.

- Gambeson: re-colored to look more like an item sprite.
- Heavy Survival Boots, Heavy Survival Suit: Reshot to look more like Master Chief or Doom guy armor.
- RM120C shotgun: Apex Mastiff
- RM228 PDW: Apex Mozambique shotgun
- RM216 SPIW: Apex Fraulein PDW
- RM232 IDW: Apex Alternator SMG
- RM103A Automagnum: Apex RE-45 Automatic
- RM11B Scout Rifle: Apex Longbow DMR
- RM2000 Submachine Gun: Apex R-99 SMG
- RM51 Assault Rifle: Apex R-301 Carbine
- RM614 LMG: Apex Devotion LMG
- RM88 Combat Rifle: Apex G7 Scout
- A7 Laser Rifle: Apex Havoc Rifle
- Kukri: Retaken because the dots were messed up

## 8. Add Clothing Modifications

Add Nomex: It can't still prevent your gear from burning, but It'll give you some beneficial flame protection.

Lighten up: Shedding some of the lining to make the gear less obstructive and less warmer. At the expense of armor. Good for gear with a high degree of warmth that has good specs and you want to wear.

Create Pouch: Literally attaches a leather pouch to your clothing to increase storage. The trade-off is a slight increase in hindrance.

## 9. Drones

### Introduction

Added a whole new bunch of robots to the game, instead of the usual manhacks, security bots, whatbots, and mechs.
In addition, this content allows players to progress from pets and carriers to humanoid combatants and eventually to walking weaponry.
Built-in ammo will be infinite for convenience. I don't want you to be stuck managing your minions' bullets.
Drones will progress from Companion > Pilot > Juggernaut or Mechs (Explorer/Predator/Stronghold).
You can move up and down in tiers freely by crafting or B, ) disassembling.

#### Drones

Simply Flying bugs.
Highly maneuverable, but not very durable except for Drones: Electro Cannon, so handle with care.

Drones: Striker

- Just like the drone companion, but with a laser pistol.
- Don't judge by the size. It's a great kiting machine against mobs.
- If you have two of them, you can even melt Kevlar Hulks with a combination of kiting and aggro distractions.

Drones: Striker MK II

- These guys have gotten bigger and are equipped with A7 laser rifles.

Drone: E-Cannon

- Big, fat EMP bombardment drones. Slightly sluggish.

#### Walkers

Slower than drones.
But have the advantage of being much stronger and bulkier.

Walkers: Attackers

- Less maneuverable than a drone, but has the advantage of being much more durable.
- This one fires 5.56mm rounds every 3 turns.

Walker: Bombardier

- Slower, but fires small grenades at long range every 6 turns.
- They won't shoot if enemy gets within 6 squares of them due to their safety distance, so you'll need to have other Walkers to escort them.

Walker: Sniper

- A quadrupedal robot that fires a 7.62mm DMR every 5 turns at very long range.

Walker: Sniper MK II
- A monstrosity that fires a .50-caliber objective sniper rifle every 7 turns at very long range.

#### Companions

Tier 1

Drones: Companions

- Think drone from Nier: Automata, or the Recovery Drone from Apex Lifeline.
- These drones are the basis for TechTrees to macro them, and since they are cores, you can build them directly from their parts as long as you can salvage an eyebot.
- It's very comfortable to think of it as an eyebot-on-a-good-side. It has the ability to be a porter, play with you to raise your mood.
- It also has a high speed of 250, and when riding a low-altitude-flying drone, the player is treated as if they were riding a horse.

Tier 2

Drones: Pilot

- Drone: A Companion with android limbs, chassis, and survival combat armor.
- It temporarily loses its ability to fly. Equipped with an A7 laser rifle and the melee abilities of a prototype robot to escort survivors.
- Can give the impression of an NPC when playing without any NPCs.

Tier 3

Drone: Juggernaut

- Drone: Power armor on the pilot. Slowed down to 100 speed, but immune to all attacks by Juggernauts.
- It can also throw enemies. To evolve to macro, take the Tech from the `Drone: Pilot`, not this one.

Tier 4

Mechs: Explorer/Predator/Stronghold

- Fusion core consumption for crafting. They don't directly use nanofabricators, but are more advanced than combat armor.
- Be very careful when using them, as they can literally smash through walls and terrain when in standalone mode.
- Can be converted between standalone and mounted mode by crafting. In fact, systematically, the only way to itemize in mounted mode (mech mode) is to kill it > repair the body > disassemble it > extract the materials > remake it. I'm really sorry, but mechs are hardcoded and this is the only way to do it.

The Explorer Mech

- Carries an wave energy rifle and a long-range laser sniper pod.
- A humanoid mech with moderate armor, moderate mobility, moderate melee, a wave rifle that bounces off enemies, and a long-range sniper with a power shot that can explode.
- Excellent at taking out multiple enemies at medium to long range, and his powershot in mounted mode makes him an excellent companion and interpersonal macro.

The Predator mech

- Features a huge serrated blade on his tail and a plasma shotgun.
- A wolf-type Mech with low armor, top-notch mobility, and excellent melee abilities.
- It has a plasma shot that burns and EMPs enemies, and melee abilities based on movement that humanoids can't perform.
- In its standalone form, it has the ability to leap, and in its mounted form, its built-in melee database allows it to use specific martial arts, such as Eskrima and Fior de Battaglia, to further amplify its destructive power.

The Stronghold Mech

- Equipped with a 12.7mm heavy machine gun and grenade launcher.
- A giant-sized Mech with top-tier armor, low mobility, and insane ranged abilities.
- No ammo limits thanks to a built-in nanofabricator that provides an instant supply of bullets.
- Everyone's favorite one-shot, one-kill grenade launcher is available in mounted mode. An excellent defensive/siege mech that is optimized for the point defense.
