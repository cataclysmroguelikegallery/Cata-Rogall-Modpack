1. made CBM: Internal Furnace and CBM: Internal Storage drop normally

2. increased lab rewards
When an Autodoc is present and a Shocker Brute is trapped inside, there is now a 66% chance that a drawer near the Autodoc will contain a high-level Bionic that drops when you dissect zombie bio-operators, instead of a regular Bionic.
Nanotemplates and Nanomaterials now have a 66% chance to drop 3x more Nanotemplates and 5x more Nanomaterials.
Centers containing a single Raptor Serum, Chimera Serum, or Smart Purifier now have a 66% chance of yielding 10 instead of 1. 
Hounds of Tyndallos now have a 66% chance to drop a locker containing a 5-point anchor or something, plus an L-stick, RX-12 syringe, and RX-12 ampoule.

3. added a map outside the lab that drops martial arts books

Adjusted the spawn rate of the Research Center Outer Map that drops Martial Arts Books.
Instead of a fixed spawn rate of 2 martial arts books from the bookshelf, the chance of an additional spawn from the bookshelf has been reduced from 5% to 1%, and the chance of a spawn from the couch has been removed.
Instead, popcorn now spawns from the couch

Separated mods into folders. Magic rebalancing.
Most offensive spells, most summon spells, and spells that use stamina have been reduced by one-tenth in resource consumption.
Weapon spells and buffs have had their duration increased by a factor of 10.
The exceptions are Finger Lighter and Death Stare, which add a lighter substitute, but Finger Lighter is useless even with 10x the duration, so it costs one-tenth the resources.
Necrotic Gaze is a skill that uses your own health to attack, but instead of costing you 20x health, it deals 20x more damage.
Changed to a skill that lives up to its name, Necrotic Gaze, which costs 40 health and deals 200-3200 damage.

Mobs using Necrotic Gaze were instantly killing players, so I rolled back Necrotic Gaze and created a new magic called Demon Eyes of Direct Death. While I were at it, I also created a book.
